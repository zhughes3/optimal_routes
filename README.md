# Optimal Routes

This project reads in data about trucks and cargo in an effort to find the minimum distance needed to deliver 
each piece of cargo.

Each piece of cargo can only be delivered once, by one truck. Some trucks will not be used.

# Run

To run the project, go to the root directory in your terminal and run:

```bash
go run main.go
```

# Notes

This project was created to ramp up and gain familiarity with the Go programming language.
